# Greedy versus Exhaustive Search

- Erik Williams :gorilla:

## Description

- set up an environment for implementing algorithms in C++, and use that to implement two algorithms that solve the same problem.

### Project Objective

- translate descriptions of two algorithms into pseudocode; analyze pseudocode mathematically; implement each algorithm in C++; test
  implementation; and describe results.

### Results
